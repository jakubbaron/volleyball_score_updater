# Overview  
This project is supposed to be updating score from the games on either FB group
posts or in a Whatsapp Group conversation  
  
[OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/04/raspbian-stretch-install-opencv-3-python-on-your-raspberry-pi/)  

## Modules to do  
* Photo OCR, recognize the score +
* Photo motion detection, no need to take picutres and read them as quickly as possible
* Photo scheduler, take a picture if a motion hasn't been detected for some
  time
* Score updater to FB/Whatsapp
* Parsing archive photos in case we lost connection and updating that to the
  posts as well

## Webinterface to do:  
* See the live stream till the moment we start taking pictures of the score,
  prob not a good idea on zero
* Being able to specify comment's ID, where Updates are supposed to be
  happening to avoid spamming with each post
* See the last picture
* ~Being able to choose Area of Interest~ <- not needed
* Show the score on the website as well

## Needed
* More tempaltes to teach OpenCV how the numbers look like
